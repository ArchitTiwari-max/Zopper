# Notification System Integration

This document outlines the notification system that has been integrated into the header component.

## Components Created

### 1. NotificationDropdown Component
**Location:** `src/components/NotificationDropdown/NotificationDropdown.tsx`

A dropdown component that displays recent notifications when the notification bell is clicked.

**Features:**
- Shows up to 4 most recent notifications
- Mark individual notifications as read
- Mark all notifications as read
- View all notifications button
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Click outside to close functionality

### 2. NotificationContext
**Location:** `src/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx`

Global state management for notifications using React Context API.

**Features:**
- Centralized notification state
- Add, remove, and mark notifications as read
- Calculate unread count
- Simulated real-time notifications (demo purposes)
- Type-safe with TypeScript interfaces

### 3. Enhanced Header Component
**Location:** `src/app/header.tsx`

Updated header component with integrated notification functionality.

**Features:**
- Notification bell with unread count badge
- Toggle dropdown on click
- Dynamic unread count display
- Improved styling with hover effects

## How It Works

1. **Global State Management**: The `NotificationProvider` wraps the entire app in `layout.tsx`, providing notification state to all components.

2. **Header Integration**: The header component uses the `useNotifications` hook to access notification state and display the bell with unread count.

3. **Dropdown Display**: Clicking the notification bell toggles a dropdown showing recent notifications with options to mark as read or view all.

4. **Shared State**: Both the header dropdown and the notifications page use the same context, ensuring consistent state across the app.

## Notification Types

- **Task**: Admin assigned tasks (ðŸ“‹ icon)
- **Approval**: Visit plan approvals (ðŸ‘¤ icon)
- **System**: System updates and maintenance (ðŸ”§ icon)

## Styling

- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Proper z-index management for dropdown overlay
- Touch-friendly sizes on mobile devices
- Dark mode support (optional)

## Usage

The notification system is automatically available throughout the app once implemented. No additional setup is required for new pages or components - they can access notifications using the `useNotifications` hook.

```typescript
import { useNotifications } from '../contexts/NotificationContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { notifications, unreadCount, markAsRead } = useNotifications();
  // Component logic here
};
```

## Real-time Updates

Currently includes a demo simulation of real-time notifications. In a production environment, this would be replaced with:
- WebSocket connections
- Server-sent events
- Polling mechanism
- Push notification integration

## Mobile Optimization

The notification dropdown is fully responsive:
- Adjusts width on smaller screens
- Touch-friendly interaction areas
- Proper spacing and sizing
- Optimized layout for mobile devices

## Future Enhancements

- Push notification support
- Notification categories and filtering
- Notification history persistence
- Custom notification sounds
- Rich notification content (images, actions)
- Notification preferences and settings
